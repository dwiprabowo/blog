    <h1>Belling The Cat</h1>
    <h3>by Aesop</h3>
    <p>
      The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free 
      themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to
      find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might
      have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for
      they lived in such constant fear of hear claws that they hardly
      dared stir from their dens by night or day.

      Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough.
      At last a very young Mouse got up and said: bell
      <blockquote>
        "
          I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.
          All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. Whe we hear
          the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming."

        It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a
        different matter to do it
